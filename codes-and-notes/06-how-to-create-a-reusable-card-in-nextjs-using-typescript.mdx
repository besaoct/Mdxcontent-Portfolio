Hey there, fellow developers! ðŸ‘‹

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create reusable cards in a Next.js application using the power of TypeScript. Cards are a common UI element in web development, and having a reusable card component can save you time and effort in your projects.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following set up:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. Basic familiarity with Next.js and React concepts.

### Setting up a Next.js Project

Let's start by creating a new Next.js project. If you already have one, feel free to skip this step.

```bash
npx create-next-app my-card-project
cd my-card-project
```

### Installing TypeScript

Next, we'll add TypeScript to our project. TypeScript provides static type checking, which enhances code quality and reduces bugs.

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```

### Creating the Reusable Card Component

Now that our project is set up with TypeScript, let's create our reusable card component. Inside the `components` folder in your project root, create a new file called `Card.tsx`.

```tsx
// components/Card.tsx
import React from 'react';
import styles from './Card.module.css';

type CardProps = {
  title: string;
  content: string;
};

const Card: React.FC<CardProps> = ({ title, content }) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.card}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Card;
```

In this example, we're defining a simple card component with two props: `title` and `content`. The component will display the provided title and content within a styled div.

### Styling the Card Component

To style the card component, we'll use CSS Modules. Create a new file called `Card.module.css` inside the `components` folder:

```css
/* components/Card.module.css */
.card {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 16px;
  margin: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

h2 {
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}

p {
  color: #444;
}
```

Feel free to customize the styles according to your design preferences.

### Using the Reusable Card Component

Now that we have our reusable card component ready, let's use it in our pages. For demonstration purposes, let's add it to the `index.tsx` page.

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx
import React from 'react';
import Card from '../components/Card';

const HomePage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Next.js TypeScript Card App</h1>
      <Card title="Card 1" content="This is the content of Card 1." />
      <Card title="Card 2" content="And this is the content of Card 2." />
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

You can use the `Card` component in any page or component of your Next.js project, making it highly reusable and maintaining a consistent design across your application.

### Running the Application

Now that we've created our reusable card component, let's run the Next.js application and see it in action.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see your homepage displaying the two cards with their respective titles and content.

That's it! You've successfully built a reusable card component in Next.js using TypeScript. Now you can leverage this component throughout your project to create beautifully styled cards with ease.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
